  By sharing content smartly you can improve staff efficiency, win more
  business and enforce compliance controls.

<p>
  The DotApprove content library is available as a plugin for Microsoft Word.
  It gives document authors the ability to search libraries of pre-approved
  content like staff biographies, photos, charts, policy wording or proven
  business winning text, which can be inserted directly into their documents.
</p>
<p>
  It's perfect for proposals, due diligence questionnaires and RFP's allowing
  documents to be completed in a fraction of the time with a consistent tone
  throughout.

<p>
  Global and local online libraries can be created giving authors 24/7 access
  to the most up-to-date content even when they're out of the office.

  And to keep compliance happy, the correct disclaimers will always be used.

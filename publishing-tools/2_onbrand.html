<p>
  Our easy to use templates work with all versions of Microsoft Office,
  ensuring brand consistency across your business.
</p>
<p>
  Perfect for stationery and client facing documents like proposals,
  presentations and reports, our OnBrand Microsoft template software will lock
  down your corporate style, helping you and your team create professional
  documents that are brand consistent and accurate without needing a designer.
</p>
<p>
  Templates can include tools for controlling fonts, layout and colour
  palettes while data can be imported to automate content creation such as for
  research documents or factsheets. Branded charts and tables can be created in
  a click and pre-approved content (such as disclaimers, biographies or staff photos)
  can be inserted using the <a href="{{ site.url }}/publishing-tools/smartshare/">SmartShare</a>
  content library straight into your documents. We can even provide you with
  tools to instantly publish content in a variety of formats including web pages,
  HTML emails and PDF's direct from your templates.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you're working in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint or Excel you can
  concentrate on writing content and adding value and let our templates take
  care of everything else.

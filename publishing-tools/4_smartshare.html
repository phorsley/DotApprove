  By sharing content smartly you can improve staff efficiency, win more
  business and enforce compliance controls.
</p>
<p>
  The DotApprove content library is available as a plugin for Microsoft Word.
  It gives document authors the ability to search libraries of pre-approved
  content like staff biographies, photos, charts, policy wording or proven
  business winning text, which can be inserted directly into their documents.
</p>
<p>
  It's perfect for proposals, due diligence questionnaires and RFP's allowing
  documents to be completed in a fraction of the time with a consistent tone
  throughout.
</p>
<p>
  Global and local online libraries can be created giving authors 24/7 access
  to the most up-to-date content even when they're out of the office.
</p>
<p>
  And to keep compliance happy, the correct disclaimers will always be used.

          Set up your content libraries in DotApprove and define user access.
          This allows you to create global libraries that are visible to all
          users and local libraries, which can be restricted by office
          locations or business divisions.

          Either upload Word files or use the capture feature within the app to
          add content to the libraries. Administrators can update content in
          the library so the latest versions are always available. Amended
          content is automatically saved in the version history to capture an
          audit trail.

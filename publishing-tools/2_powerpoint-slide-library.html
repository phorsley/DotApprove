  Centrally manage, approve and store your presentations and slides ensuring
  the most up-to-date, compliant and on brand content is used across your
  business.
</p>
<p>
  DotApprove's online slide library gives your presenters 24/7 access to the
  latest presentations allowing them to quickly and easily browse and insert
  pre-approved slides, charts, images and videos using our PowerPoint plugin.
</p>
<p>
  Old presentations and slides are instantly updated with the latest versions
  so you know the most up-to-date content is used. Any new or edited slides
  contain a "not approved" watermark, forcing presenters to get any bespoke
  content signed-off before their presentation.
</p>
<p>
  Administrators can manage libraries and content and define whether slides are
  locked or editable. Workflows allow reviewers to sign-off bespoke content and
  collaborate and approve slides before they're released to the library.

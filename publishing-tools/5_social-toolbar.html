  DotApprove gives firms the ability to embrace social media with the peace of
  mind that online conversations are compliant, on brand and fully archived.
</p>
<p>
  DotApprove's Social Toolbar for Twitter has been developed to help you comply
  with regulations.
</p>
<p>
  It gives companies the ability to manage all their corporate Twitter accounts
  from one central online dashboard ensuring any financial promotions are
  clear, fair and not misleading.
</p>
<p>
  The key benefits are the level of control and the archiving and audit trail
  that it gives to financial firms. You decide which Twitter accounts an
  employee can view and post to and which messages have to be approved by
  compliance.
</p>
<p>
  Users can view timelines, search for hashtags or key words, monitor mentions
  and direct messages and keep track of followers and who you follow.
</p>
<p>
  Automated workflows ensure messages are approved promptly and an audit trail
  of all comments, changes and approval signatures is automatically captured.
</p>
<p>
  All messages including responses to customer service queries are archived to
  meet regulatory requirements. When the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) come
  to audit, simply search to find your Tweet and view the audit trail to prove
  the correct approval process was followed.

          Set up your content libraries in DotApprove and define user access.
          This allows you to create global libraries that are visible to all
          users and local libraries, which can be restricted by office
          locations or business divisions.

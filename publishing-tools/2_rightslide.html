<p>
  Our presentation management software gives you all the tools you need to
  control brand consistency and access a searchable library of presentations,
  slides and images ensuring the most up-to-date and compliant content is used
  across your business.
</p>
<p>
  RightSlide includes PowerPoint template tools to guarantee the correct fonts,
  colours, styles and designs are used while branded charts, graphs and tables
  can be instantly created and inserted from Excel or the chart library.  Your
  presenters will have 24/7 access (online and offline) to a library of the
  latest  presentations and the ability to search and select pre-approved
  slides, images and videos.
</p>
<p>
  Administrators can manage libraries and content and define whether slides are
  editable or locked so they canâ€™t be changed by presenters to improve
  compliance controls. Any new or edited slides can contain a "not approved"
  watermark, forcing presenters to get any bespoke content signed-off before
  their presentation.  Workflows within DotApprove allow reviewers to
  collaborate and approve slides before they're released to the library.
</p>
<p>
  When slides (such as fund performance charts) are amended and published to
  the library all presentations that contain those slides are automatically
  updated saving significant time while ensuring the latest content is always
  used. Users will even be prompted when opening locally saved presentations of
  any slides that have been updated and can use the compare feature to select
  which slides to refresh.
</p>
<p>
  RightSlide helps even inexperienced PowerPoint users to create beautiful,
  on-brand and compliant presentations quickly and easily.

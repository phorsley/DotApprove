<p>
  Our easy to use templates work with all versions of Microsoft Office,
  ensuring brand consistency across your business.
</p>
<p>
  Perfect for stationery and client facing documents like proposals,
  presentations and reports, our Microsoft template software will lock down
  your corporate style, helping you and your team create professional documents
  that are brand consistent and accurate without needing a designer.
</p>
<p>
  Templates can include tools for controlling fonts, layout and colour
  palettes. Branded charts and tables can be created in a click, while
  compliant information (such as disclaimers, biographies or staff photos) can
  be inserted from the DotApprove content library straight into your documents.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you're working in Microsoft Word, PowerPoint or Excel you can
  concentrate on writing content and adding value and let our templates take
  care of everything else.

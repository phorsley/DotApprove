  DotApprove gives firms the ability to embrace social media with the peace of
  mind that online conversations are compliant and on brand.
</p>
<p>
  DotApprove's Social Toolbar for Twitter has been developed to help you comply
  with regulations.
</p>
<p>
  It gives companies the ability to manage all their corporate Twitter accounts
  from one central online dashboard ensuring any financial promotions are
  clear, fair and not misleading.
</p>
<p>
  The key benefit is the level of control that it gives to financial firms. You
  decide which Twitter accounts an employee can view and post to and which
  messages have to be approved by compliance.
</p>
<p>
  Users can view timelines, search for hashtags or key words, monitor mentions
  and direct messages and keep track of followers and who you follow.
</p>
<p>
  Automated workflows ensure messages are approved promptly and an audit trail
  of all comments, changes and approval signatures is automatically captured.
</p>
<p>
  All messages and version histories are archived to meet regulatory
  requirements. When the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) come to audit,
  simply search to find your Tweet and view the audit trail to prove the
  correct approval process was followed.

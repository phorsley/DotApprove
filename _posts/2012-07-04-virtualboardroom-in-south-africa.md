author: Steve Coleman

The VirtualBoardroom World tour has now reached South Africa following trips to
Switzerland, Holland and Cayman Isles earlier this year. Robin Bishop and
Graham Bowstead have managed to escape the British summer for an intense week
of presentations in Johannesburg and Cape Town.

Our dynamic duo will be meeting more than twenty companies to demonstrate our
board portal features and ipad integration. So far, they have had great
feedback and three companies have already asked to go live.

Robin and Graham will be back this weekend in time for a rain delayed Wimbledon
final!

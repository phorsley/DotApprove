The FCA has published its long-awaited update on social media for financial
promotions.

The new guidelines are in the form of a consultation document: the FCA is
inviting us all to send our comments by email to
{% include email.html email='Richard.Lawes@fca.org.uk' %} by 6th November.
After this, the FCA will take on board feedback received to fine-tune and
finalise their approach.

In their announcement of the consultation, the FCA acknowledges the fact that
social media is becoming increasingly prevalent as a means of communicating
with customers and potential customers – in financial services as in every area
of business.

The regulator continues to take the stance that ‘financial promotion rules are
intended to be media-neutral’ as this ensures that ‘consumers are presented
with certain minimum information, in a fair and balanced way, at the outset of
firms’ interaction with them’. In other words, in general, the FCA’s approach
to social media promotions is the same as to promotions via any other media.

The FCA also recognises the value of social media in communicating with
customers: ‘Social media... are powerful channels of communication and
therefore of significant value to firms. The FCA does not want to prevent their
use’.

The key points of the FCA’s updated approach are:

* That ‘any form of communication (including through social media) is capable
  of being a financial promotion, depending on whether it includes an
  invitation or inducement to engage in financial activity’. As a result, all
  financial promotions, including those communicated via social media, need to
  be compliant.
* The need to be mindful of social media’s ability to take your promotion to a
  wide audience very quickly. Firms should consider this in their decision to
  use social media, and their decisions about what messages they promote this
  way.
  The FCA says that ‘Firms should therefore ensure that their original
  communication would remain fair, clear and not misleading, even if it ends up
  in front of a non-intended recipient (through others re-tweeting on Twitter
  or sharing on Facebook)’.  
  They suggest the use of software that allows niche groups to be targeted very
  specifically as a way to manage this risk – although clearly, this can’t
  prevent your promotion being shared and ultimately reaching a wider audience.
* They acknowledge the difficulty of creating a balanced promotion when using
  social media, with its character limitations – and suggest that this might at
  times lead firms to opt for a different marketing channel.  
  The need to convey not only the benefits but also the risks of a product – a
  key aspect of the FCA’s ‘fair, clear and not misleading’ requirements – can
  be difficult to achieve when promoting often-complex products via social
  media, with its limitations on word and character count.
  As a solution, the FCA suggests ‘signposting’ a product or service on social
  media, with a link to more comprehensive information elsewhere online – for
  example, on your own website.  
  They also suggest that in some cases it may be more appropriate to use ‘image
  advertising’ than social media. Firms will need to make a decision – as they
  already do – as to which marketing channel best conveys their message in the
  most compelling and yet compliant way.

The consultation paper also has specific guidance around:

Promotions for investment products – where there is a specific requirement that
financial promotions for investment products are identifiable as promotions. A
generally accepted way to do this, that the FCA suggests using, is the use of
‘#ad’ in social media posts.

The need for stand-alone compliance – reminding firms that all communications,
including tweets and Facebook postings, need to comply with the appropriate
rules in its own right.

Risk warnings and other required statements: the FCA reminds firms that these
apply to social media in the same way as to any other medium, and again
acknowledges the difficulty of complying with this in character-limited social
media.

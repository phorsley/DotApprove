title: Checking and approving PowerPoint presentations 
author: Steve Coleman

When we speak to marketing or compliance clients, a few themes pop up again and again. One we hear probably more than any other is the frustration at the amount of time they spend checking and approving PowerPoint presentations (in addition to reviewing all their other marketing and sales materials).  This is particularly true in the regulated financial services sector, where [financial promotions]({{ site.url }}/news/2014/fca-clamps-down-on-financial-promotions/) need to show evidence of an approvals and sign off process.

One client told us that she checks over 1000 presentations a year, and every day opens presentations knowing she has probably already approved the majority of the slides – but has to check them again just in case a small change has been made.

We have found that many firms waste a huge amount of time in this way, either identifying which slides need to be approved and/or rechecking the same slides over again as there is no record of what has been approved previously.

There aren’t many marketing or compliance professionals who would choose to spend their time on this repetitive work.  Without this recurring administration, marketing and compliance teams would be freed up to do more of the work they want to do.

### RightSlide presentation management software enhancement

We’re delighted to announce an enhancement to our [RightSlide presentation management software]({{ site.url }}/publishing-tools/rightslide.html) that relieves this burden. You can now add “Draft” watermarks to new or edited slides making it easy to identify content that requires approval and prevent non-approved slides being sneaked into presentations.

Each slide in RightSlide now can be created in one of four ways:

1.	Fully editable – anyone can edit: suitable for slides that don’t require approval such as cover slides
2.	Editable with watermark –  anyone can edit, but a ‘Draft’ watermark appears on the slide, forcing the presenter  to get any new content approved
3.	Unlockable – anyone can unlock the slide for editing, but this places a ‘Draft’ watermark across the slide. This again forces the editor to have any amended content approved prior to their presentation
4.	Locked – restricts standard users from editing the slide to ensure content remains compliant: useful for information such as disclaimers, which will not change
 
### New PowerPoint slide approval feature

The new built-in slide approval feature makes it easy for reviewers to identify which slides in a presentation need to be checked and signed-off. Authorised approvers are prompted when new slides need approving, and can see a list of all the slides that require sign-off. Once the ‘approve’ button is pressed, the ‘Draft’ watermark is automatically removed and the slide is locked to ensure no unauthorised changes are made. 
 
### Audit trail of PowerPoint slide approval

The process of watermarking and approving edited slides creates a clear audit trail for financial promotions presentations. The name of the approver plus the date and time of sign-off is automatically added to the metadata for each slide to capture an audit trail for regulators like the [Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).](http://www.fca.org.uk/) As a result, time spent checking slides is radically reduced. 
 
We have created a short overview video of the enhancements but if you’d like to see all the features in action, please contact us at: [solutions@perivan.co.uk](mailto:solutions@perivan.co.uk) or call 020 7562 2222.

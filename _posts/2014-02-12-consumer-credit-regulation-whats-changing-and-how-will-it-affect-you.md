title: 'Consumer credit regulation: what’s changing and how will it affect you?'

The countdown to the transfer of consumer credit regulation is gathering pace.
FCA Chief Operating Officer, Leslie Titcomb announced: "Over 31,000 firms have
already registered for interim permission placing us well ahead of schedule as
we move closer to 1 April, when the FCA takes over the regulation."<sup>1</sup>

 The change will significantly impact:

* Hire purchase companies
* Credit card issuers
* Payday loan companies
* Pawnbrokers
* Debt management and collection firms
* Providers of debt advice

Any businesses affected will need to register with the FCA (via their website)
by 31 March 2014. The FCA differs from the Office of Fair Trading in that it
has:

* Wider enforcement powers – and states that its aims include; bringing more
  enforcement cases and pressing for tough penalties for infringements of
  rules;
* A stricter approach to companies’ compliance and risk governance processes
* A strong focus on; Treating Customers Fairly; – a key tenet of the FCA’s
  regulation and one that businesses will need to prove that they address

The FCA has already forced firms to withdraw over 200 promotions (adverts and
marketing materials) in 12 months for failing to comply with its conditions.

The expectation is that it will take a similarly tough approach with consumer
credit companies. All of this means that affected businesses will be under
increased pressure to demonstrate that their processes and outputs meet the
FCA’s stringent requirements. Companies in the consumer credit market will need
well-documented processes and policies, as well as clear-cut governance and
compliance frameworks. You will also need to ensure that all your documentation
is both fully compliant and updated with details of the new regulator.

Does your business currently have all of these? Does the content of your
promotions meet the FCA's strict regulations? Have they been produced and
reviewed in a way that would comply with their guidance? If not, you could well
be on the FCA’s radar.

don’t fall foul of the new regulators rules. If you’re worried about the impact

Did you know that you can add comments and compare slides in PowerPoint? When
we ask this question at our training sessions, 9 times out of 10 the response
is “I didn’t know you could do that”.

The concept is similar to tracking changes in Word or adding sticky notes to a
PDF. It’s a great tool for reviewing and approving presentations, allowing you
to collaborate with colleagues and mark up content changes – or add design
comments like “do not use clipart”!

If your business is regulated, tracking changes in PowerPoint enables you to
capture a version history of all amendments to a document – very handy when you
are audited by a regulator such as the
[Financial Conduct Authority](http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/being-regulated/financial-promotions)
(FCA).

DotApprove users have the added benefit of enabling multiple reviewers to add
their comments and changes to one centrally-stored PowerPoint file in the
knowledge that the version history is automatically captured.

If you want to learn how to track changes in PowerPoint then we’ve created a
free user guide that you can download below.

The guide takes you through a simple step-by-step process with screen shots
that are easy to follow.

First, we show how to insert comments and see annotations from colleagues. Then
we explain how to compare two versions of a PowerPoint presentation and view
the changes.

This is really helpful if a colleague has changed a presentation rather than
marking up their comments. The ‘compare’ feature will allow you to see each of
the changes that your colleague has made and either accept or reject their
amendments.

We will shortly be adding a free guide to creating perfect charts in PowerPoint
so please revisit our blog to download a copy.

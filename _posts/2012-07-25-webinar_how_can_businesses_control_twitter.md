We had such a great response and feedback to our first webinar so we have
decided to run two more!

Register for 2pm on 2nd August or 11am on 7th August.

In this 30 minute webinar, we will cover:

* Controlling access - how to manage which employees can post messages to your
  corporate twitter account
* Approval workflows - ensuring all tweets and retweets are approved before
  they are posted
* Social media governance - keeping an archive and audit trail of all your
  online conversations including approval signatures
* Speeding up response times - through co-ordination of compliance, PR and
  marketing teams
* Monitoring success - measuring the impact of your social media activity with
  reporting tools

All attendees will be offered a free trial of our social media management
software, DotApprove.

This week, the FCA has been shown to be taking an increasingly tough stance on
financial promotions.

New research from regulatory consultants
[Bovill](http://www.bovill.com/news-releases/61-percent-rise-in-financial-promotions-withdrawn-or-amended-by-FCA-in-last-year.aspx)
\* shows that there has been a 61% increase in the number of financial
promotions withdrawn or amended by the FCA in the twelve months to June 2014.

Financial services firms were asked to withdraw or change a total of 328
financial promotions in the 12 months to June – almost one a day, up from 208
in 2012/13.

Bovill cites ‘an increasingly interventionist approach by the FCA’ along with
‘a raft of recent updates to the rules on financial promotions’ for the
increase.

In August, the FCA demonstrated this interventionist approach by using – for
the first time – its powers to intervene in the sale of financial products. In
this case, they issued temporary product intervention rules restricting the
distribution of 
[Contingent convertible instruments](http://www.fca.org.uk/news/restrictions-in-relation-to-the-retail-distribution-of-contingent-convertible-instruments)
(commonly known as CoCo’s) to retail investors for one year.

The regulator has also been increasingly robust in issuing fines for
non-compliance of financial promotions. In June, the 
[FCA fined Credit Suisse International and Yorkshire Building society](http://www.fca.org.uk/news/fca-fines-credit-suisse-and-yorkshire-building-society-for-financial-promotions-failures)
a total of £3.8m for publishing misleading financial promotions.

The firms were simultaneously fined as manufacturer and distributor of a
product, in a first for the FCA, and both accused of failing to ensure that the
product’s promotions were clear, fair and not misleading.

The new figures, and these recent examples, show that financial services firms
are still struggling to meet the FCA’s increasingly stringent requirements. New
guidance and updates – for example on the use of social media for financial
promotions – are making an already complex area even trickier to navigate.

It can be easy for firms to inadvertently cross the boundary from acceptable to
unacceptable when it comes to financial promotions.

In this environment of increased regulatory powers and intervention, anyone
marketing financial services has an ever-more challenging role. Financial
promotions that meet the requirements – both in content and in the compliance
processes that support their production – are vital if you want to avoid
falling foul of the regulator.

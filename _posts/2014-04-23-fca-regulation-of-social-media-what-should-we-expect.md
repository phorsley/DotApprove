The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was due to publish new regulatory
guidance on the use of social media in the first quarter of 2014. So far, this
has yet to be issued – but this hasn’t stopped (or has perhaps increased!)
speculation over what it might contain.
<!--more-->
When they took over from the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in July 2013,
the FCA stated that they had no plans to update the FSA’s 2010
guidance<sup>1</sup> on social media. This guidance stated that any
communication that goes beyond the FSA’s definition of ‘image advertising’ will
need to comply with all of the relevant financial promotion rules.

In other words, the FSA viewed Twitter, Facebook and other social media
channels in the same way as any other financial promotion, and expected the
same level of compliance. It didn’t, though, give any concrete guidance on how
firms might achieve this compliance for a channel that is designed to be
immediate and responsive. The ‘real time’ nature of social media – where
clients and customers expect an instant response – doesn’t fit easily with the
compliance audit trails and approvals processes required for other forms of
financial promotion.

Since the FSA guidance was released in 2010, there has been an explosion in the
use of social media for business-to-business marketing: clear guidance on
compliance is needed more than ever.

To date, the FCA has demonstrated a more ‘hard-line’ approach to compliance
than its predecessor. In the year to June 2013, it forced firms to withdraw or
amend over 200 financial promotions, according to regulatory consultancy
Bovill<sup>2</sup>.

The FCA’s social media guidelines are therefore expected to be stringent. They
are also likely to reflect the growing use of social media as a marketing
communications channel – and to be more specific than the previous guidance
about the regulator’s expectations.

If the FCA continues the stance that social media posts should be subject to
the same governance as other marketing communications, this will demand:

* That all social media communications are reviewed before being issued, to
  ensure they are compliant.
* Governance around who is able to make social media posts on the business’s
  behalf
* A compliance process that provides the same level of audit trail for social
  media communications as for other financial promotions

The current lack of guidance on how firms can manage social media compliance
may already be putting firms off from using this marketing channel: at a recent
financial services conference, when delegates were asked why they don’t
currently use social media, the most popular answer was that ‘Compliance won’t
let me’.<sup>3</sup>

Clearer guidance on what firms are expected to do, and how they might achieve
compliant social media, will therefore be welcomed.

Social media undoubtedly provides a huge opportunity for financial services and
other regulated firms, enabling engagement with clients and advisers, rapid
responses to topical issues and a swift, succinct communications channel for
key messages.

Firms with a clear approvals process and audit trail for social media
promotions may be able to steal a march on competitors who have not yet made
arrangements for this area of their marketing.

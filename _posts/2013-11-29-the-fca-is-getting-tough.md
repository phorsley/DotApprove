title: The FCA is getting tough
author: Daniella

Events of the past few months have made it clear that the Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA) is getting serious.  Perhaps keen to demonstrate that they will
be taking a more robust approach than their predecessor, the Financial Services
Authority, the FCA has not been afraid to challenge financial promotions that
fall short of their strict requirements.

A recent survey  by compliance consultants Bovill showed that, in the 12 months
to June 2013, the FCA forced firms to amend or withdraw 204 financial
promotions.  Bovill cites this as evidence that firms are struggling to ensure
their financial promotions  comply with the FCA’s rules. 

The explosion in the use of social media for marketing, in both a
business-to-consumer and business-to-business context, has made the minefield
of compliance even more difficult to navigate.  Increasingly, firms are
concerned about their social media policies and output meeting the FCA’s
criteria.  The very nature of social media makes it an ‘instant’ medium, with
firms often less inclined or able to get timely sign-off for Tweets or
Linkedin/Facebook posts, as this can negate the immediacy of the message.

In some cases, firms may not even be aware that their social media activity is
policed by the FCA in the same way as their other financial promotions.  And
even if they are, it can be difficult for firms to know about, and manage,
social media marketing, responsibility for which is often devolved to
individuals within the business. It is this lack of awareness that can cause
approval processes to fall foul of the FCA’s requirements, and cause promotions
via social media to break the rules.

So what are the reasons why financial promotions are falling short of the
requirements? Typical potential stumbling blocks might include:

* Warning statements being written in fonts that are too small and difficult to
  read.
* Excessive use of investment jargon in promotions
* Citing in a promotion a potential return that gives a misleading impression
  of the investment’s short and long term prospects.
* Promotional advertisements that describe potential returns as "guaranteed",
  "protected" or "secure" with no supporting information. 
* Consumers not being adequately warned in print that a product or service
  might place their investment at risk.

The penalties for businesses who don’t meet the FCA’s regulations are clear,
and potentially severe.

The firm can face fines, reputational damage and potential compensation
payments to affected clients. Individuals at those firms can face a fine, up to
two years imprisonment, or both.  The possibility of reputational
embarrassment, financial penalty, and even personal punishment are evidently
significant.

Businesses realise that they need to take seriously the issues of compliance
and easily-evidenced approvals processes. New rules enable the FCA to publicly
name companies that fall short of the requirements, whereas under the FSA,
firms were warned privately before any public rebuke was issued. 

So – given that the penalties are potentially significant, and that the rules
are being ever-more stringently policed, what can firms do to stay out of
trouble?

A comprehensive and thoroughly-documented approvals process is the key.
Ensuring you can prove compliance with the approvals requirements is vital in
case of an audit by the FCA.  It should also, of course, ensure that all your
financial promotions meet the requirements.  As described above, making sure
even your social media output is compliant is essential, and this can be the
hardest to police.

Technology, like DotApprove, will help by streamlining the approval process and
automatically archiving all messages with a clear audit trail. DotApprove

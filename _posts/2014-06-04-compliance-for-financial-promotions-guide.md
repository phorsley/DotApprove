title: Compliance for financial promotions – a marketing guide
author: Steve Coleman
---
Anyone who works in marketing for a regulated industry, such as financial
services, needs to understand the importance of compliance.

For those new to regulated industry marketing, it can be a whole new world.
Marketing materials – from publications, to adverts, to digital marketing – are
classed as ‘financial promotions’, and as such are subject to rigorous
regulatory guidance by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the body that
regulates the financial services industry.

Having to get marketing materials signed off, not just by management but also
by your Compliance team, can be an eye-opener, lengthening the production
process and adding to the layers of approval that marketing collateral needs to
go through before it can be finalised.

And the actual approval of your promotions is only one part of the equation. In
addition, the whole sign-off process, including any changes, needs to be
documented to provide an audit trail. This audit trail provides evidence to the
FCA – if they decided to audit your firm – that your promotions have been
through the proper sign-off procedure before being published.

All of which adds to the lead time Marketing teams need to build in, and can
generate an extra layer of admin in terms of the management, tracking and
documenting of the approvals process.

Understanding the role of the Compliance team – what they have to do, and why –
can be very helpful in ensuring that collaboration between Marketing and
Compliance runs smoothly.

Some of the things it can be useful for Marketing to be aware of include:

**What constitutes a financial promotion, and what is a ‘real time financial
promotion’?**

**Why are financial promotions so heavily regulated?**

**How does the FCA assess financial promotions, and what are they looking for?**

**What is your Compliance team’s role in making sure your financial promotions
meet the FCA’s criteria?**

**What are the common pitfalls for financial promotions?**

**Are there any changes planned for the FCA’s regulations?**

On 24th June, we’re sponsoring ComPeer Limited’s event on Wealth Management
Business Performance.

The event is ComPeer’s annual presentation of its Wealth Management
Benchmarking Study, which examines the revenues, profits, assets and the issues
driving business performance of the key players in the UK Wealth Management
Industry.

As well as the report’s findings, the event will also feature presentations
from the Wealth Management Association (WMA), the British Banking Association
(BBA) and the City of London Police, speaking on cybercrime.

Designed for senior wealth management professionals (who attend the event for
free), it should provide a fascinating insight into the UK’s current key wealth
management companies.

The event takes place on Tuesday 24th June from 8.00am - 12.30pm at Merchant
Taylors’ Hall in the City of London

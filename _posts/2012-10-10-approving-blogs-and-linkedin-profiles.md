title: Approving blogs and LinkedIn profiles
author: Steve Coleman
---
We’re pleased to announce that DotApprove has been extended to give companies
the tools they need to approve and archive blog posts and employee LinkedIn
profiles.

The increasing trend for social media as a marketing tool means that blogs and
LinkedIn are an important way for businesses to build their online following.
Increased regulatory scrutiny means you need to ensure that what your employees
write is compliant. Saving blog posts directly into DotApprove will allow for
collaboration and content approval prior to posting online. While employee
LinkedIn profiles can be checked, approved and archived so that regulated
individuals can take advantage of the social network without worrying about
compliance.

This update is the latest enhancement to DotApprove following the success of
our Twitter approval tool which was launched in July. We have listened to
market feedback and we know that Marketing and Compliance departments need to
be able to manage, review and approve all avenues of marketing from social
media to web sites and bid documents.

DotApprove gives you the tools to effectively manage and approve all your
collateral.

If you’re looking to improve your approval processes then please get in touch

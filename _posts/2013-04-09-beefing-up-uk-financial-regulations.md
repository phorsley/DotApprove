title: Beefing up UK Financial Regulations
author: Daniella

A recent *Which?* report highlights that over half UK consumers have changed
their shopping habits in light of the horsemeat scandal. The public has lost
trust in the food industry and the scandal has highlighted the need for changes
in the way standards are enforced. When people buy something, they want to know
that what’s inside the packet is exactly the same as what’s marketed on the
packet. And this thought process extends way beyond the supermarket shelves. It
impacts all purchase decisions, whether it’s a house, a car, or even an
investment or savings product.

Given the spate of scandals in recent years, there are arguably similar levels
of distrust of the financial industry. From the credit crisis to mis-selling of
PPI, the LIBOR fixing to toxic products, you can see why consumer confidence in
the financial system is at an all time low. The time couldn’t be better for the
launch of a tougher, ‘beefier’ regulator to step up to the mark.

The change in regulator on the 1st April should therefore be welcome news for
consumers. Regulation of the UK financial system moved from the FSA to 2 new
bodies: the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) (focusing on protecting
consumers) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) (concentrating on the
prudential regulation of firms). This very significant change puts consumers at
the heart of the system, as outlined by the FCA’s three objectives:

1. To protect consumers
2. To enhance market integrity
3. To build competitive markets

There are probably some consumers out there thinking this is a case of ‘closing
the stable door after the horse has bolted’. Some of you might think likewise.
But the regulator recognised there were some things they might have been able
to prevent if they had the power to do so. This has driven them to rip up the
rulebook and start again. They want to totally rewrite the DNA of the financial
industry to make sure consumers are at the heart of each firm’s decision-making
process. For example, the FCA will be able to ban a product outright if they
think it’s unsuitable for investors. They will be able to stop a firm from
marketing and advertising a product or service if they think it isn’t clear, or
it misleads its audience. They can make public any disciplinary action against
a firm who goes against their rules, to deter other firms from similar
behaviour.

In their 2013/2014 business plan, published last week, the FCA identifies 5
priority areas on which they’ll focus:

* Product design: Firms don’t currently design products that correlate with
  real consumer needs.
* Distribution: There is a lack of transparency for consumers.
* Technology: There’s an over-reliance on (and not enough oversight of) payment
  and product technologies.
* Innovation: There’s been a move towards innovative, complex or risky funding
  strategies that pose a risk to market integrity and consumer protection.
* Understanding: There’s not enough understanding of risk and return amongst
  consumers.

This all bodes very well for consumers, who should get the protection they need
and start putting their trust in the financial system once more. But what does
this actually mean if you’re a firm overseen by the FCA? First, it’s important
that you understand the new rules. There are some significant changes that have
happened, and it’s important that you adapt to meet these changes or else you
risk public censure and penalties. Has your product been designed with a target
consumer in mind? Is your marketing clear, fair and not misleading? Is your
technology robust enough for your business?

If you’re concerned about how strong your processes are or how the changes
might impact your workload, we have the solution. Whether you need an approval
management system for your marketing campaigns with a transparent audit trail,
the ability to keep track of updating old disclaimers or a method to publish
social media in a controlled way, we can help.

We’ve developed DotApprove, a system specifically designed to help you become
FCA-compliant by streamlining your marketing management, storage and approval
processes in one easy-to-use online system.

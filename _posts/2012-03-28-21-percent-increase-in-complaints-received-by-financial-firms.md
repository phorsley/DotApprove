The FSAâ€™s latest [complaints
data](http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/library/other_publications/commentary/index.shtml),
published today, shows the total number of complaints received by financial
firms increased by 21 per cent in the second half of 2011 to 1,256,172. The
increase was due to a rise in complaints about general insurance and pure
protection products, up 49 per cent to 1,280,940.

If social marketing is about content then the 2013 industry practitioners forum
on social media & financial services managed to squeeze a lot into one day.
With talks and round tables from marketing, PR and social media big hitters to
compliance consultants, lawyers and a keynote speech by Richard Lawes from the
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

The morning started with a panel of social media experts from Barclaycard,
First Direct and CME Group discussing the lofty question: "How are financial
services firms taking social media strategy to the next level of maturity"?
These retail giants are clearly ahead of the game with their use of social
media having invested significantly in monitoring software and employing teams
to constantly check and respond to customer service queries. This is out of
necessity with a social media savvy customer base believing that a complaint
made on a public forum will get a quicker response. But it's not just about
customer service. All three companies have built impressive social media
strategies and an enviable following by "listening", "responding" and engaging
with clients rather than using social media to just promote their products.

This theme was continued in the next speech by Alpesh Doshi from FINTRICITY who
explained how social media had the potential to transform all areas of a
business helping them become more engaged, transparent and agile. He gave an
example of how firms could transform their compliance approval process by
collaborating and approving collateral online, saving substantial time and
money. He also encouraged financial firms to learn from other sectors, such as
"the Dell idea storm" and use social media to engage with clients and ask what
products they should develop.

Richard Lawes then gave an informative speech that clarified the FCA's approach
to social media. He covered the following topics:

1. Fair, clear and not misleading - "always consider it from the customer
   perspective"
2. What is a financial promotion - "an invitation or inducement to engage in
   investment activity"
3. Character limitation - "consider issues such as risk warnings or including a
   5 year chart when past performance is referred to"
4. Real time? - "Twitter is not interactive, so promotions on it are non-real
   time"
5. The customer journey "fair and balanced information at each stage"

I was hoping to get a scoop on some new FCA rules on the use of social media
but alas, no such announcement was forthcoming. This is a shame as the
delegates that I spoke to felt they would benefit from better defined rules and
examples of best practices to help them with the compliance of social media. An
example of the confusion was whether it is sufficient to include a link to a
disclaimer within a Twitter message (the one click rule). It isn't, the
"standalone rule" applies so the Tweet must be compliant.

In terms of best practices, Balwin Berges from Silk Invest Asset Management
gave a passionate talk on how "thinking like Hollywood" could help you create
content that was "useful" + "genuine" + "consumable" to give you "authority". I
was really impressed with how he had used blogs, videos and podcasts to tell
stories that educated people on their investments. Check out their story on
"[Nigeria - The land of entrepreneurs](http://www.silkinvest.com/2013/08/nigeria-the-land-of-entrepreneurs.html)"
to give you a few ideas.

We then had talks by Lee Werrall of CEI Compliance Limited, Russell D. Sacks
from Shearman & Sterling and Ashley Hurst from Olswang who all gave pragmatic
advice on complying with SEC, FINRA and FCA regulations and how to respond to a
crisis. Ashley provided a very helpful action plan, which you should consider
before your business uses social media:

1. Identify key internal stakeholders and form a social media focus group
2. Identify what your organisation wants to achieve through employee use of
   social media
3. Identify the relevant social media channels
4. Identify the key legal risks for your organisation
5. Collect existing policies which may impact on employee social media
6. Form a clear view as to the desirable/acceptable bounds of social media use
   and draft a strategy document
7. Draft/amend social media policy and guidelines as appropriate
8. Form a crisis team to respond to negative stories
9. Establish a training plan
10. Build an integrated online communication network for crisis response

One thing that was clear from the day is that with 1.73 billion<sup>1</sup>
people using social media, financial firms can't ignore it as a channel. The
key is to implement a strategy, provide appropriate training for staff and
ensure that compliance is integrated so the process is seamless.

Technology, like our product DotApprove will help by streamlining the approval
process and automatically archiving all messages with a clear audit trail. When
the FCA does come to audit you can prove the correct procedures for social
media were adhered.

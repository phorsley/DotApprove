After months of waiting, the FCA has confirmed that it will be publishing
social media guidance in the first quarter of 2014. The announcement will come
as a welcome relief for financial services firms and advisers and will
hopefully provide some much needed clarity and social media best practices.

An FCA spokesman said the guidance had not stemmed from any particular concern
but was in response to increased questions from firms.

He said: ‘We are developing social media guidance in response to the financial
services industry but also because we are fully aware about the increased use
of social media.’

The regulator continually monitors the use of social media and we've been
informed by a number of firms and advisers that they've been asked to remove
messages because they weren't compliant. 

While we await the announcement, here are our top 10 best practices for
financial firms and advisers using Twitter:

1. Create a clear social media policy 
2. Train employees on the policy and any relevant technology 
3. Follow up and re-educate any employee that breaks the policy 
4. Only publish content that is fair, clear and not misleading 
5. Approve financial promotions before publishing 
6. Ensure content is standalone compliant 
7. Any Tweet that is a financial promotion should begin with the word "Ad:" 
8. A Twitter message is classified as non-real time 
9. All Twitter messages including responses to Tweets should be archived 
10. Images can be used to overcome character limitations e.g. A picture of a 5
    year performance chart 

Technology, like our product DotApprove will help by streamlining the approval
process and automatically archiving all messages with a clear audit trail. When
the FCA does come to audit you can prove the correct procedures for social
media were adhered.

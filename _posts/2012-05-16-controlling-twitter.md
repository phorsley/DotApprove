We’re excited to announce that we have integrated twitter into DotApprove, our
project management and approval software. Clients can now check and approve
their twitter messages prior to posting to ensure compliance and protect their
brand values. It's easy to use, quick to install and is available on a monthly
user rate.

Here are some of the features and benefits:

* Manage team access to your twitter accounts and control individual
  permissions removing the risk of unsanctioned activity
* View all your twitter timelines in one dashboard to monitor brand mentions
  and effectively respond to your audiences in real-time
* All tweets must be checked and approved before they can be posted, which puts
  marketing in control and keeps compliance/legal happy
* Post approved messages to multiple accounts
* Speed up response times through co-ordination of compliance, legal and
  marketing teams
* Version history and audit trail of all comments, changes and approval
  signatures is automatically captured
* Archive all tweets by day, week or month to provide a searchable record of
  your online conversations
* Share, track and analyse your links with integrated Bit.ly URL shortening
* Synchronise social media sign-off and approval processes for all your
  marketing material from one platform

We will be adding LinkedIn, Facebook and Google+ shortly to provide a single
platform to manage all your social media needs. So whether you need to control
regulatory compliance or just check what is being said, DotApprove gives you
the assurance to take advantage of the phenomenal growth and reach of social
media.

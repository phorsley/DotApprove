The FCA promised to take a tougher stance with companies that don’t adhere to
their rules and it’s done so, fining miscreants at seven times the rate the FSA
used to. New data shows that in the ten months since it began regulating the
financial sector the FCA has issued £408 million in fines. As a comparison, The
FSA averaged £68m per year in its eleven years of existence. Regulatory experts
are warning the FCA will continue levying record penalties and hit firms with
much bigger “American-style” fines.

Fines since 2004

One thing that hasn't changed is the reason for the fines: client
communications are still a major factor.

Nevertheless, many companies are still taking a haphazard approach to financial
promotions approval: updating logs in spreadsheets manually, using email
inboxes to store audit trails and even using paper based checklists. These
processes are riddled with holes and occasional errors are inevitable.

Companies that don’t want to play Russian roulette with FCA compliance should
consider introducing software such as DotApprove, which was designed for this
purpose. A well thought out, software based quality system with obligatory
sign-offs would have prevented many of the transgressions that the FCA are now
punishing. An Audit trail and version history of your financial promotions are
automatically captured removing the need for manual updating. It also improves
speed to market as the compilation and approval process becomes quicker and
slicker.

Mary Stevens, manager of regulatory analysis at Wolters Kluwer Financial
Services, said: "Firms need to continue to monitor existing and new products
and services to ensure they are fully compliant with regulatory requirements if
they are to avoid the penalties that we are currently seeing."

The financial penalties are heavy, but the reputational damage could be worse.

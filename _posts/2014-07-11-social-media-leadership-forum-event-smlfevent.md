Financial services professionals attending the SMLF event seeking clear
guidance from the FCA on the use of social media will have left disappointed.
As one attendee Tweeted, “Not sure I expected clarity, but I didn’t expect
muddled. Not clear if guidance is coming and if it is, who’s had a say? #smlf
event”.

Although we didn’t get clarity the event was still a fascinating insight into
how financial services firms are (or are not) using social media. In a show of
hands, the majority of the audience see social media as an opportunity but only
a handful conceded that they weren’t scared of using it. As an example of the
fear factor, one high street bank admitted its Tweets are reviewed by eight
different departments before they were posted.

Andrew Hill from the Financial Times (who won the award for smartest dressed
attendee) advised firms to use social media to promote positive messages, not
just to respond to consumer complaints. He said, “Trawl the Twitter feeds of
many UK retail finance groups and you will quickly pull up endless apologies to
individual customers – sorry to hear that, and so on”, which he referred to as
“sorry media”.

There were examples of financial firms that are using social media
successfully. The common factor was compliance advising their marketing teams
on what can and can’t be posted and then monitoring (by following) rather than
vetting every message. Social media after all should be about engaging with
customers and not just posting promotions. 

Interestingly, those firms that weren’t scared of using social media such as
nutmeg have employed marketers from outside the financial sector who don’t have
the inherent fear of compliance issues.

Richard Lawes from the FCA stressed that “social media is just one of the
channels available to marketers and as such shouldn’t be treated differently to
any other promotion”. He urged firms to use “common sense” before posting
messages to social media. The long awaited social media guidance paper will now
be published later this summer. There will then be a consultation period where
we can all feedback our comments before the paper is finalised.

While we await the announcement, here are our top 10 best practices for
financial firms and advisers using Twitter:

1. Create a clear social media policy
2. Train employees on the policy and any relevant technology
3. Follow up and re-educate any employee that breaks the policy
4. Only publish content that is fair, clear and not misleading
5. Approve financial promotions before publishing
6. Ensure content is standalone compliant
7. Any Tweet that is a financial promotion should begin with the word "Ad:"
8. A Twitter message is classified as non-real time
9. All Twitter messages including responses to Tweets should be archived
10. Images can be used to overcome character limitations e.g. A picture of a 5
    year performance chart

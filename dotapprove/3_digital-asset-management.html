<p>
  DotApprove's digital asset management software helps you to easily store and
  share assets across your business.
</p>
<p>
  It allows you to create global and localised libraries to centralise access
  for all your brand assets including guidelines, logos, banners, images,
  videos, Microsoft templates and for legal assets such as policy documents and
  disclaimers. In fact any file (or asset) you can think of can be securely
  stored and shared with your staff or third parties such as agencies.
</p>
<p>
  It's quick and easy to search, edit and download files as you need them and a
  version history and audit trail is automatically captured every time you
  update a file.
</p>
<p>
  The asset library can be extended using our content and slide library tools
  allowing staff to browse and insert approved content into their documents and
  presentations when using Microsoft Word or PowerPoint.

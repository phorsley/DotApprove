  With automated sign-off stages and centralised collaboration DotApprove will
  make your approval process more efficient and effective.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you are checking marketing collateral for brand consistency, ensuring
  content meets your Treating Customers Fairly rules or managing the compliance
  approval of your financial promotions, DotApprove will streamline your
  processes saving significant time and money. Different approval workflows can
  be set up for each type of collateral including checklists, ensuring that
  vital steps aren't missed out.
</p>
<p>
  Any type of collateral can be reviewed and approved  including websites,
  blogs, emails, Twitter messages, PDF's and Microsoft files, which are stored
  in DotApprove to meet regulatory requirements. Reviewers add their comments
  and changes to centrally stored files, reducing the likelihood of errors,
  duplication and conflicting changes. This efficient review process reduces
  the number of proof stages and enables you to control agency input and bring
  down their costs.

<p>
  DotApprove reduces your risk of breaching regulations by automatically
  archiving all collateral and creating an audit trail of every proof and
  sign-off stage.
</p>
<p>
  The audit trail provides a complete version history, so you can refer back to
  previous stages, reviewer's comments, check list answers and approval
  signatures. All collateral and financial promotions are stored electronically
  in their original format including working snapshots of websites, so you can
  keep a record of how your website appeared on a specific date. The powerful
  search facility allows you to scan through the entire system and within
  document content. This is particularly useful when specific details such as
  disclaimers need to be updated.
</p>
<p>
  DotApprove makes it simple to prepare for and quickly respond to requests for
  information or audits by regulators such as the FCA, PRA, FINRA or SEC.
</p>
<p>
  You can also set up expiry dates and email alerts, so that you can plan your
  work load efficiently and ensure that all company compliance deadlines are
  met.

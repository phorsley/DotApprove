<p>
  DotApprove centralises project management so you can plan, review, approve
  and store all of your documents and marketing material from a single online
  platform.
</p>
<p>
  Managing marketing and PR campaigns across multiple channels while ensuring
  content is compliant and onbrand can be challenging, particularly when
  working with multiple agencies, suppliers and office locations. Add in all of
  the other documentation that you produce from bids and proposals to last
  minute PowerPoint presentations that sales are demanding and it’s difficult
  to keep track of what’s happening where.
</p>
<p>
  DotApprove makes it simple. The dashboards give an instant view of all
  projects, timelines, suppliers and approval stages with on screen filters.
</p>
<p>
  You can capture consistent project briefs using online forms that are
  tailored to your needs. While automated email reminders help you manage
  schedules, alert you when review deadlines are approaching, warn you of
  missed deadlines and allow you to plan for forthcoming compliance expiry
  dates.
</p>
<p>
  With 24/7 global access, no matter how many projects you manage you will
  always know the exact stage that each project has reached.

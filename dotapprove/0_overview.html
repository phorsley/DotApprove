  DotApprove is a secure online marketing and compliance portal that
  streamlines the project management, approval process and archiving of all
  marketing collateral, documentation and social media to your defined rules.

  If your business is regulated, or you're looking to improve corporate
  governance and brand consistency, DotApprove can help. It makes the
  management and approval process simple allowing you to keep track of all your
  projects and know what stage they've reached.

  time and money and helps get your collateral to market quicker. By making

      DotApprove is a web-based compliance portal that brings marketing and
      compliance teams together to collaborate over, approve and project manage
      all their documents and marketing material quickly and efficiently.  It
      streamlines the sign off process, eradicating paper trails which are
      easily lost or mislaid and enforces the firm's compliance procedures.  It
      retains a permanent audit trail and material is easily located and
      retrieved to meet with the FCA regulations and requirements.  It also
      ensures our brand, tone and content is consistently applied across the
      organisation irrespective of the publication or distribution location.
      As a result of its success the product has been rolled out to all our
      offices and is also being reviewed by other business areas to help them
      meet their objectives. F&amp;C marketing and compliance believes
      DotApprove would enhance any firm's marketing processes and compliance
      procedures.

      DotApprove has transformed our internal marketing approval process. It is
      extremely easy to use! Reviewers are prompted via email, which provides
      them a link to the relevant online folder required for sign off. This
      gives quick and easy access so they can review and approve marketing
      material. Before, we spent so much time chasing people to sign off
      marketing material, but DotApprove automatically reminds reviewers if
      they are coming close to a deadline which is saving us lots of time. Jobs
      go through far less proof stages because reviewers can now open and
      comment on one central file, and instantly see everyone else's comments.
      So much time used to be wasted deciphering handwriting, collating
      everyone's comments which then had to be sent back to our agency. With
      DotApprove this is now already done for us clearly and concisely, so now
      we get the new proofs back from our agency much faster! We are also
      saving hundreds of pounds every month on printing costs. There is no need
      for filing cabinets full of paper job bags anymore and finding archived
      jobs is much easier with the search option. I would highly recommend
      DotApprove to any marketing, compliance and PR teams. Everyone at Perivan
      has been so helpful with the implementation and changes have been made to
      tailor our needs. No ask is too much!

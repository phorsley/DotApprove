  As part of our feedback process with our clients we ask them to complete a
  survey on the benefits of using DotApprove.
</p>
<p>
  Among the many positive effects DotApprove has had on their business is the
  reduced risk of breaching regulations, significant time and costs savings and
  a lower environmental impact. You can assess the evidence for yourselves by
  reading the following case studies.

<h2>
  Schroder's – Reduced risk and simplified compliance approval
</h2>
<p>
  Schroder's have seen a dramatic improvement in managing compliance approval
  allowing them to enforce procedures and free-up staff to concentrate on
  marketing rather than admin.
</p>
<p>
  The process of producing and approving marketing material is now much faster,
  which has reduced their lead times and improved their speed to market.

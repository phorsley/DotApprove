<p>
  DotApprove was developed in response to clients' frustration with the way
  they collate comments and sign off on new marketing material.
</p>
<p>
  For many, the process was time consuming and laborious and inefficiencies
  meant they were exposed to breaching regulations such as the Financial
  Conduct Authority.
</p>
<p>
  Our vision is to continue streamlining the process of project managing,
  reviewing and approving all documentation, marketing collateral and social
  media.  The amazing results we've achieved in automating processes that
  improve compliance and brand consistency, reduce administration and risk and
  significantly save time and money are what motivate us.
</p>
<p>
  We are very excited about the possibilities for adding new features and
  continuing to resolve clients' problems.
</p>
  <p>
  The team behind DotApprove has many years' experience in designing and
  developing software and web applications for financial and professional
  services firms. We're part of Perivan Limited who were established in 1937
  and now employ over 70 staff based at our London and Edinburgh offices.
</p>
<p>
  The company is 100% owned by its employees, which helps foster a positive,
  proactive culture. We have over 250 clients worldwide and the financial
  muscle to continually invest in product development.

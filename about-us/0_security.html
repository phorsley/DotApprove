<p>
  DotApprove is particularly relevant to those organisations that require a
  rigorous method of storing electronic assets and collateral and recording
  their approval records for compliance purposes.
</p>
<p>
  We have numerous security features in place to keep your information safe
  both on and offline. These include our world-renowned hosting provider and
  intelligent encryption facilities.
</p>
<p>
  DotApprove also protects you against any loss of access to information if
  your internal systems go down, helping with business continuity and
  preventing you from losing vital pieces of work.
</p>
<p>
  DotApprove is used by many leading financial and professional services firms
  and other regulated companies. Security is therefore the number one priority,
  which is why we selected Rackspace, one of the world's leading hosting
  providers to be our partner.
</p>
<p>
  Rackspace offers exacting, rigorous standards and delivers unparalleled
  security, power, connectivity and environmental control.

<h2>Information Security</h2>
<p>
  Information Security is of critical importance to Perivan due to the nature
  of our business activities, and the trust placed in us by our clients when we
  handle their extremely confidential data. We therefore have a very strong
  security awareness culture that permeates every management and staff level at
  Perivan.  
</p>
<p>
  Our working practices conform to ISO27001 standards and our processes are
  audited. We are working towards extending our ISO27001 Certificate to
  encompass DotApprove.
